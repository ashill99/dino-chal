Spent a few hours working on it - mostly at the beginning to get all my dinosaurs in order and at the end to sort out the ducking.


high score: 1289 


At first, it took a while to figure out which elements I needed and how to work out when there were obstacles but once I got that working, I was able to figure out the right syntax to use the dispatchEvent listener to add jumping. 

I played around a while to discover the optimum x-axis distance for jumping but kept getting stuck at the birds. 

Managed to discover the y-axis for the birds and was able to add in a new duck function to avoid them. 

However, this meant the dino would duck and not get up. I put it in a settimer to get back up and this solved the ducking problem.
